## The Database

The map above draws on the **Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database** (TASTDB), the most comprehensive record of the forced migration of enslaved Africans across the Atlantic Ocean. Compiled over decades by an international team of scholars, the database documents individual voyages — ships, ports of departure and arrival, numbers of people embarked and disembarked, mortality at sea, and the national flags under which these voyages sailed.{{ footnote(id="1", content="David Eltis and David Richardson, eds., *Atlas of the Transatlantic Slave Trade* (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2010). The database is maintained at [slavevoyages.org](https://www.slavevoyages.org/).") }}

A companion dataset, the **Intra-American Slave Trade Database**, records voyages that moved enslaved people *between* ports in the Americas — from Caribbean islands to mainland colonies, from one colonial power's territory to another.

Together, these databases represent a monumental scholarly achievement. They are also, by necessity, incomplete.

The trans-Atlantic trade spanned more than three centuries (1514--1866). At its peak, hundreds of voyages per year carried enslaved people from the coasts of West and Central Africa to plantations in Brazil, the Caribbean, and North America. The mortality rate across the Middle Passage averaged **13.7%** — roughly one in seven people embarked did not survive the crossing.{{ footnote(id="2", content="Calculated from TASTDB: 10,665,568 estimated embarked vs. 9,202,995 estimated disembarked across 36,108 documented voyages.") }}

Between 1800 and 1820 — the two decades that frame the documents discussed below — the database records **5,455 trans-Atlantic voyages** carrying an estimated 1.6 million people.{{ footnote(id="3", content="TASTDB filtered for YEARAM 1800--1820: 5,455 voyages, 1,606,167 estimated embarked, 1,428,351 estimated disembarked.") }} The year 1808 marks a visible inflection point: both the United States and Great Britain formally abolished the trans-Atlantic slave trade that year. The number of voyages drops sharply — then recovers, as illegal trade continued under different flags and through different ports for decades afterward.

## What the Database Does Not Capture

The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database documents **voyages across the ocean**. It does not — and cannot — capture what happened to enslaved people once they arrived in the Americas.

It does not record:
- **Domestic sales** between slaveholders within a state or territory
- **Sheriff's seizures** and court-ordered repossessions of enslaved people as property
- **Notarial acts** of purchase and sale executed in cities like New Orleans, Charleston, and Richmond
- **Inheritance transfers**, where enslaved people passed from one generation of slaveholders to the next
- **The internal forced migration** of roughly one million enslaved people from the Upper South to the Deep South between 1790 and 1860

These transactions — smaller in scale than the ocean crossings, but no less devastating to the people caught in them — generated their own paper trail: court petitions, bills of sale, ship manifests for the coastwise trade, notarial records. They are preserved in archives across the former slaveholding states and territories.

Three such documents survive in the records of New Orleans. They tell the story of **Eulalie Bayeron**, a free woman of color who bought, lost, and sold enslaved people between 1807 and 1827.

## Voices in the Archive: New Orleans, 1807--1827

### The Ship Manifest

{{ image_with_caption(url="ship-manifest.jpeg", caption="Manifest of Slaves on board the Schooner Sémillante, bound from New Orleans for the Port of Bay Saint Louis. District of Mississippi, May 29, 1827.", credit="New Orleans Notarial Archives") }}

This printed form documents the **coastwise domestic slave trade** — the movement of enslaved people by ship between American ports. A single entry records **Francoise**, a 24-year-old Black woman, five feet and one inch tall, shipped by **Pierre Liquet** of New Orleans aboard the schooner *Sémillante*, master **Jn. Lopez**, to Bay Saint Louis, Mississippi.

The manifest's most revealing feature is the oath at the bottom. The shipper and the ship's master swear

> *solemnly, sincerely and truly ... according to the best of our knowledge and belief, that the persons above described were not imported into the United States since the first day of January, 1808, and that under the laws of the State, they are held to service and labour.*

This is the **1808 oath** — the legal mechanism by which the domestic coastwise trade distinguished itself from the now-illegal trans-Atlantic importation.{{ footnote(id="4", content="The Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves, signed March 2, 1807 and effective January 1, 1808 (2 Stat. 426), banned the importation of enslaved people into the United States. The domestic trade — moving enslaved people already within the country — remained legal.") }} The form itself is a kind of legal fiction: it certifies the legality of an inherently brutal commerce by framing it as a question of *importation dates* rather than *human rights*. Francoise was not "imported" — she was already enslaved, already within the borders, and therefore could be legally shipped like cargo.

Documents like this one — and there were tens of thousands — do not appear in the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database. Francoise's forced journey from New Orleans to Bay Saint Louis is invisible to the map above.

### Eulalie's Petition (1810)

{{ image_with_caption(url="eulalie-bayeron-blase-cenas.jpeg", caption="Petition of Eulalie Bayeron, fille de couleur libre, to the Honorable City Court of New Orleans, ca. 31 May 1810.", credit="New Orleans Notarial Archives") }}

Around May 31, 1810, **Eulalie Bayeron** — identified in the document as a *fille de couleur libre*, a free daughter of color — filed a petition with the New Orleans city court. She reported that on August 29, 1807, she had purchased an enslaved man named **Victor** in **Santiago de Cuba** (*S[ain]t Yague de Cuba*) from a man named **Dupuis** for **350 piastres**. Victor is described as a *nègre bossal* — a term derived from the Spanish *bozal*, meaning a person recently arrived from Africa who had not yet been creolized into the colonial culture.{{ footnote(id="5", content="The term *bozal* (French *bossal*) distinguished recently arrived Africans from *criollos/créoles* — enslaved people born in the Americas. It carried implications about language, cultural assimilation, and market value.") }}

Eulalie states that she possessed Victor "peacefully and without trouble" until the day before the petition — **May 30, 1810** — when Sheriff **B. Cénas** of the 1st District of the Superior Court seized Victor. The seizure was not for any debt of Eulalie's. It was executed under an *attachement* (writ of attachment) obtained by a man named **Joseph Gelliés** against **Pierre Liquet**, for a debt Gelliés claimed Liquet owed him.

Victor — a human being — was seized as **attachable property to satisfy someone else's debt**.

Eulalie petitions the court to order the sheriff to return Victor as her "legitimate property," to pay her four escalins per day for Victor's labor from the date of seizure until his return, and to cover all court costs. The petition is signed by **Seghers** on her behalf.

{% end %}

Several dimensions of this document deserve attention.

**Free people of color as slaveholders.** Eulalie occupied a distinct social stratum in Louisiana — the *gens de couleur libres*, free people of color who existed in a legal and social space between enslaved Black people and white colonists. Under French, then Spanish, then American law, some free people of color accumulated property, including enslaved people. Eulalie's petition is not unusual for its time; it is part of a well-documented pattern in which the institution of slavery was maintained not solely by white slaveholders but by a broader system in which property rights in human beings were available to anyone with the means to purchase them.{{ footnote(id="6", content="See Kimberly S. Hanger, *Bounded Lives, Bounded Places: Free Black Society in Colonial New Orleans, 1769--1803* (Durham: Duke University Press, 1997).") }}

**The Santiago de Cuba connection.** Victor was purchased in Santiago de Cuba in 1807, one year before the American ban on slave importation took effect. Santiago de Cuba was a major hub for the Caribbean slave trade — the TASTDB records **56 voyages** arriving there, carrying an estimated 13,367 enslaved people, predominantly under Spanish and French flags.{{ footnote(id="7", content="TASTDB filtered for ARRPORT = Santiago de Cuba: 56 voyages, 15,304 estimated embarked, 13,367 estimated disembarked, spanning 1810--1853.") }} As a *bozal*, Victor had likely been brought to Cuba from Africa on one such voyage before Eulalie purchased him there and brought him to New Orleans.

**Repossession.** The legal mechanism at work here is chilling in its ordinariness. Pierre Liquet owed money to Joseph Gelliés. Gelliés obtained a court order — an *attachement* — to seize Liquet's property. But it was not Liquet's property that was seized; it was Eulalie's. The sheriff took Victor from Eulalie because someone *else's* creditor believed that someone *else* owed him money. A human being was treated as an asset that could be attached, seized, and transferred to satisfy a debt he had no part in.

### The Sale of Marie (1817)

{{ image_with_caption(url="marie-sale.jpeg", caption="Notarial act for the sale of Marie, an enslaved woman, from Eulalie Bayeron to Jean Antoine Bernard. New Orleans, 17 May 1817.", credit="New Orleans Notarial Archives") }}

Seven years after the petition for Victor, Eulalie appears again in the notarial records — this time as a seller. On **May 17, 1817**, before a New Orleans notary, Eulalie Bayeron sold an enslaved woman named **Marie**, described as a *négrette* aged approximately twenty-five years, to **Jean Antoine Bernard**, a *commerçant* (merchant) residing in the city, for **725 piastres** paid in cash.{{ footnote(id="8", content="At 725 piastres (equivalent to approximately 725 US dollars in 1817), this was a substantial sum — roughly equivalent to $18,000--$20,000 in present-day purchasing power.") }}

The notarial act specifies that Marie had been acquired by Eulalie from **Pierre Liquet** — the same Pierre Liquet whose debts led to Victor's seizure — by an act before the notary **Michel de Armas** on **September 2, 1815**.

{% accordion(id="marie-tabs", title="Read the key passage in French and English") %}
**French (key passage):**

> ...Au sieur Jean Antoine Bernard, commerçant demeurant en cette ville, ici présent & acceptant, acquérant pour lui ses héritiers ou ayants causes, une négrette nommée Marie, âgée d'environ vingt cinq ans, qui appartient à la venderesse, comme étant celle qu'elle a acquise du sieur Pierre Liquet, par acte au rapport de M[aît]re Michel de Armas, sous la date du deux Septembre mil huit cent quinze.
>
> La présente vente est faite & consentie pour & moyennant la somme de sept cent vingt cinq piastres, que le sieur acquéreur a payé comptant à la venderesse...

**English translation:**

> ...To the sieur Jean Antoine Bernard, merchant residing in this city, here present and accepting, acquiring for himself, his heirs, or assigns, a young negress named Marie, aged approximately twenty-five years, who belongs to the seller, being the one she acquired from the sieur Pierre Liquet, by act before Maître Michel de Armas, under the date of the second of September, one thousand eight hundred fifteen [September 2, 1815].
>
> The present sale is made and agreed upon for and in consideration of the sum of seven hundred twenty-five piastres, which the said buyer has paid in cash to the seller...
{% end %}

**The Pierre Liquet thread.** Liquet connects all three documents across twenty years. In 1810, Liquet's debts to Joseph Gelliés led to the seizure of Victor. Eulalie acquired Marie from Liquet in 1815. By 1817, Eulalie was selling Marie — perhaps to raise capital, perhaps because she needed to, perhaps for reasons the archive does not reveal. And in 1827, Liquet himself appears on the ship manifest as the owner shipping Francoise to Bay Saint Louis. What is clear is that the lives of enslaved people were entangled in webs of debt, obligation, and commerce that extended far beyond any single transaction.

**The commodification of Marie.** The notarial language is precise and cold: Marie is sold with a warranty (*garantie*), as one would sell a house or a horse. The act specifies her age, her provenance, the chain of ownership. She is, in the eyes of the law, a piece of property being transferred between parties for a stated price. The notary records the sale; the witnesses sign; the piastres change hands. Marie's own experience of this moment — her fear, her grief, her rage, her resignation — is not part of the record.

## The Domestic Slave Trade

The three documents above represent a fraction of a vast archive. Between 1790 and 1860, approximately **one million enslaved people** were forcibly moved from the Upper South (Virginia, Maryland, Kentucky) to the Deep South (Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama) through the domestic slave trade — a migration scholars have called the **"Second Middle Passage."**{{ footnote(id="9", content="Ira Berlin, *The Making of African America: The Four Great Migrations* (New York: Viking, 2010); Walter Johnson, *Soul by Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave Market* (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1999).") }}

New Orleans was the **largest slave market in the antebellum United States**. Between the 1808 federal ban on importation and the Civil War, the city's slave pens, auction houses, and notarial offices processed tens of thousands of sales. None of these domestic transactions appear in the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database.

{% accordion(id="post-1808", title="The trade after 1808") %}
The federal ban on slave importation, effective January 1, 1808, did not end the slave trade. It transformed it.

**Trans-Atlantic smuggling continued.** The TASTDB records **8,459 voyages** after 1808, carrying an estimated 2.8 million people. Most of these voyages were bound for Brazil and Cuba, where the trade remained legal longer, but some illegally supplied the American South as well.

**The domestic trade expanded.** With legal importation cut off, the price of enslaved people in the Deep South rose sharply. Slaveholders in Virginia and Maryland found it profitable to sell "surplus" enslaved people to the cotton and sugar regions. This domestic trade — conducted overland in coffles, by ship along the coast, and through urban slave markets — became one of the largest forced migrations in American history.

**The legal infrastructure adapted.** Documents like the ship manifest above, with its 1808 oath, represent the legal machinery that enabled the domestic trade to operate openly. The oath was a bureaucratic checkpoint — a moment where the state acknowledged that the trade in human beings required at least the *appearance* of legal regulation.
{% end %}

The map above tells one story — the oceanic story, the Middle Passage, the ships and the ports and the numbers. The documents below the map tell another: the story of what happened after arrival, in the courts and notarial offices and sheriff's departments of the slaveholding South. Both stories are necessary. Neither is complete without the other.
