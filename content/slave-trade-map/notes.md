### Transcription

This is a printed form with manuscript entries. The transcription preserves the printed text in roman type and handwritten entries in *italics*.

> **MANIFEST of Slaves** on board the Schooner *Firm Maint* of burthen *[?]* tons, whereof *In [?] Be[?]* is at present Master, bound from the Port of **NEW-ORLEANS** for the Port of *Bay Saint Louis*.

**Table of enslaved persons:**

| NAMES | SEX | AGE | STATURE (ft/in) | CLASS | SHIPPERS or OWNERS | RESIDENCE |
|-------|-----|----:|:-----------------|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| *Francoise* | *Female* | *24* | *5 / 1* | *Black* | *Firm Sypert* | *new Orleans* |

> **DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI** — Port of New-Orleans, the *22d* day of *[?]* 182*3*
>
> *[?]* owner of the Slaves named and particularly described in the above Manifest, and *[?]* Master of the *Sch[ooner] [?]* do solemnly, sincerely and truly *Sw[ear]* according to the best of *our* knowledge and belief, that the persons above described were not imported into the United States since the first day of January, 1808, and that under the laws of the State, they are held to service and labour.
>
> SO HELP *us* GOD.
>
> *[Signature]*

### Contextual Notes

**Form type.** This is a standard coastwise slave manifest, required by federal law after 1807. The Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves (2 Stat. 426) mandated that any shipment of enslaved people between American ports be accompanied by a manifest certifying that the individuals were not illegally imported.

**The 1808 oath.** The sworn statement at the bottom is the key legal mechanism. By affirming that Francoise was not imported after January 1, 1808, the shipper and master established the legality of the domestic transaction. The oath makes no inquiry into *how* Francoise came to be enslaved — only *when* she entered the United States.

**Column analysis:**
- **NAMES**: Only a first name is recorded. Enslaved people were typically denied surnames in official documents.
- **CLASS**: "Black" in this context refers to skin color classification, not free/enslaved status (which was assumed by the document's nature).
- **SHIPPERS or OWNERS**: "Firm Sypert" — likely a commercial firm involved in trade between New Orleans and the Mississippi Gulf Coast.

Pourquoi votre petitionnaire requiert que ledit Sr Bd. Cour Shiriff, soit cité à comparaitre à votre audience, pour y être condamné a remettre ledit negre Victor à votre petitionnaire, comme sa proprieté légitime, et à lui payer les loyers dudit negre à raison des quatre Dollars par jour depuis le jour de la Saisie jusqu'à celui de la remise qui en sera faite à votre petitionnaire; en sus il est aux frais de cette instance.

To the honorable Court of the city of New Orleans

Eulalie D'Ayeron, free daughter of color, residing in this city;

Humbly states;

That, on the 29th day of August of the year 1807, she purchased in Santiago de Cuba, from Mr. Dupuis, a bozal negro named Victor, for the price of three hundred and fifty Piastres which she paid to said Dupuis, as appears from the act of sale, which your petitioner offers to produce before this honorable court;

That since then she has possessed said negro peacefully and without trouble until yesterday the 30th of May 1814, but that on said yesterday B. Cenas, Sheriff of the 1st District of the Superior Court of this territory, took it upon himself to seize said negro Victor belonging to your petitioner, and this by virtue of an attachment or order of seizure, obtained in this honorable court by a certain Joseph Gothies against one named Pierre Liquet, for a claimed debt that said Gothies says is owed to him by said Liquet.

Wherefore your petitioner requests that said Mr. Bd. Court Sheriff be cited to appear at your hearing, to be condemned to return said negro Victor to your petitioner, as her legitimate property, and to pay her the wages of said negro at the rate of four Dollars per day from the day of the Seizure until that of the return which shall be made to your petitioner; in addition to the costs of this proceeding. And you will do justice.

Seghers, for the plaintiff

### Contextual Notes

**Document type.** This is a *requête* (petition) addressed to the city court. Petitions of this type were the standard mechanism for challenging unlawful seizures of property in the Orleans Territory.

**Orthography.** The original preserves the scrivener's spelling, which reflects early 19th-century Louisiana French conventions:
- *Shiriff* for *shérif* — a Gallicized rendering of the English word "sheriff"
- *bossol* for *bozal* — from the Spanish, meaning an African-born enslaved person not yet acculturated to colonial society
- *Piastres* — the standard monetary unit in colonial Louisiana, equivalent to the Spanish silver dollar and roughly equal to one US dollar

**Key persons:**
- **Eulalie D'Ayeron / Bayeron**: Free woman of color (*fille de couleur libre*). The surname appears in variant spellings across documents — D'Ayeron in the petition, Bayeron in the 1819 sale.
- **Victor**: Enslaved man, described as *bossol* (recently arrived from Africa). Purchased in Santiago de Cuba in 1807.
- **Sr Dupuis**: Seller of Victor in Santiago de Cuba. No further identification.
- **B. Cenas**: Blase Cenas, Sheriff of the 1st District of the Superior Court of the Territory of Orleans.
- **Joseph Gothies**: Creditor who obtained the writ of attachment against Pierre Liquet's property.
- **Pierre Liquet**: Debtor. Also appears in the 1819 sale as the person from whom Eulalie originally acquired Marie in 1805.
- **Seghers**: Attorney or agent who signed the petition on Eulalie's behalf.

**Legal mechanism.** The *attachement* (writ of attachment) was a pre-judgment remedy allowing a creditor to seize a debtor's property before trial. The problem in this case is that Victor belonged to Eulalie, not to Pierre Liquet. The petition alleges that the sheriff wrongly seized Eulalie's property to satisfy Liquet's debt — a third-party claim that the court would need to adjudicate.

### Contextual Notes

**Document type.** This is a *vente d'esclave* (sale of a slave), a standard notarial act executed before a licensed notary with witnesses. Such acts constituted the legal proof of ownership transfer in Louisiana civil law (derived from French and Spanish legal traditions, unlike the common-law systems of most other American states).

**Notary.** Marc Lafitte, a New Orleans notary. Notarial acts in Louisiana had the force of authenticated legal instruments — they did not require further court validation to be enforceable.

**Key terms:**
- *f.C.L.* — *femme de Couleur Libre*, free woman of color. The marginal abbreviation was standard notarial shorthand.
- *garantie* — warranty. The seller warrants that Marie is her property to sell, free of third-party claims and mortgage debts, and without redhibitory defects (hidden physical or mental conditions that would entitle the buyer to rescind the sale).
- *vice ou maladie rédhibitoire* — redhibitory vice or disease. Under Louisiana civil law (derived from Roman law via the French *Code Civil*), a buyer could return a purchased enslaved person within a specified period if they discovered undisclosed defects. This legal doctrine treated enslaved people identically to livestock or other chattel.
- *piastres* — Spanish silver dollars, the standard currency. 725 piastres was a significant sum, reflecting Marie's age (25 — in her prime working years) and condition.

**The Pierre Liquet connection.** The act explicitly states that Eulalie acquired Marie from Pierre Liquet in 1805, before the notary Michel de Armas. This is the same Pierre Liquet whose debts to Joseph Gothies led to the seizure of Victor in 1814. Liquet thus appears as a common thread connecting at least two of the three documents in this collection.

**Signatures.** Eulalie signed with a mark rather than a written signature, suggesting she was not literate in the formal sense — though she was clearly capable of navigating the legal system, whether through her attorney Seghers or through other intermediaries.

## Methodology

These transcriptions were prepared from high-resolution digital images of the original documents. The following conventions apply:

- **Original spelling and orthography are preserved.** The documents reflect early 19th-century Louisiana French and English usage. No corrections have been made to spelling, grammar, or punctuation.
- **Illegible passages** are marked with *[?]*.
- **Abbreviated words** are expanded in brackets where the expansion is certain: S<sup>r</sup> = Sieur, M<sup>tre</sup> = Maître.
- **The ship manifest** is a combination of printed form text and handwritten entries. Handwritten portions are rendered in *italics* in the transcription.
- **The notarial act** (Document 3) is partially transcribed. Passages of standard notarial boilerplate that are illegible or formulaic are indicated with [...]. The key substantive passages — identification of parties, description of the enslaved person, price, and chain of ownership — are transcribed in full.
- **Translations** aim for accuracy over elegance. Legal and technical terms are translated as closely as possible to their English legal equivalents.
