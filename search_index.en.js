of Columbia Slave Codes of 1860. It is one of the last slave codes in the United States and across the Americas.\nA defining characteristic of this slave legislation is how it transforms judicial rulings into codified law. Notably, it codifies the Dred Scott v. Sandford decision, which denied citizenship to all Black people, enslaved or free. It codifies other court rulings, many of which come from William Cranch's books of court case rulings.\n\nThis corpus of slave legislation can be seen as a \"practice book\" from which law firms in D.C. could reference matters of slavery.\n\nCodifying Case Law\nIn the United States, converting case law into legislative law is one of the most powerful acts that can be done when it comes to securing civil rights and human rights. In this slave code is a notable anti-civil right:\n\nA free negro of the African race, whose ancestors were brought to this Country and sold as slaves is not a \"citizen\" within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States. Dred Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. 393.\n\nWith just one sentence, D.C. legislators codified the stripping of Black people's citizenship and, consequently, their civil and human rights. Here is an excerpt from the Dred Scott v. Sandford opinion:\n\nthe African race is not and never was recognised either by the language or purposes of the former; and it has been expressly excluded by every act of Congress providing for the creation of citizens by naturalization, these laws, as has already been remarked, being restricted to free white aliens exclusively.\n\nAnti-civil rights laws could be codified with a mere pen stroke 165 years ago, while today, enshrining even just one civil right or human right into law requires moving mountainsâ€”a direct result of inherent white supremacy and patriarchal power structures.\nFreedom of Choice Act and the Equal Rights Amendment\nThe Freedom of Choice Act is a bill that, if passed, would codify Roe v. Wade into legislative law, i.e., giving women \"the fundamental right to choose to bear a child; terminate a pregnancy prior to fetal viability; or terminate a pregnancy after viability when necessary to protect her life or her health\"1.\nDespite being introduced four separate times in Congress, this bill has repeatedly failed to secure passage, even with majority public support for the past two decades as shown by Pew Research2.\nFor over a century, grassroots efforts have come and gone to codify the Equal Rights Amendment that would state something to the effect of:\n\nMen and women shall have equal rights throughout the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.\n\nTime and time again, white supremacy and patriarchal power structures in the United States have confined and eroded the key principle found in the Declaration of Independence: \"all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights.\" And time and time again, it has required extraordinary moral courage and collective action to challenge these power structures to establish, broaden, or secure the human and civil rights supposedly bestowed in the Declaration of Independence. The promise that all people are created equal and endowed with unalienable rights remains perpetually unfulfilled without continuous fight.\nManumission Template\nThis legislation also provides a template for manumission:\n\nDeed of Manumission\nTo all whom it may concern, be it known, that I ____ of the District of Columbia, county of Washington, for divers good causes and considerations, me thereunto moving, have released from slavery, liberated, manumitted, and set free, and by these presents do hereby release from slavery, liberate, manumit, and set free, my negro ____, named ____ being of the age of ____ years, and able to work and gain a sufficient livelihood and maintenance, and ____ the said negro ____ named ____ I do declare to be henceforth free, manumitted, discharged, from all manner of service or servitude to me, my executors or administrators, forever.\n\nTranscription Notes\n\nSpelling by and large is left as is. That is, the spelling of names in court cases cited is not guaranteed to be accurate but instead reflects what is written. My guess is that as this document was handwritten, the names were orated to the writer without clarification of spelling.\n\nThere are a small handful of names that I've corrected (which of these I don't remember) because I looked up what the court ruling stated to understand what was inferred from the legislative clause.\n\n\nI've also left the transcription as I found it from each page. However, Clause 23 under Slaves to be slaves for life seems cut short from the previous page. Based on context, I believe the complete clause should read:\n\n\nXXIII. And, forasmuch as many people have neglected to baptize their negroes, or suffer them to be baptized, on a vain apprehension that negroes, by receiving the sacrament of baptism, are thereby manumitted &amp; set free; But hereby further declared and enacted, by and with the authority advice and consent aforesaid, That no negro or negroes, by receiving the holy sacrament of baptism is thereby manumitted or set free, nor hath any right or title to freedom or manumission, more than he or they had before; any law, usage or custom to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nThis statement is consistent with British legal concepts on baptism of slaves versus indentured servants3, and we see that they persist after the colonies became American states (and Washington, D.C., a federal district made from them).\nDred Scott Decision and Birthright Citizenship in the 2nd Trump Administration\nOn the day of Donald Trump's second inauguration, he signed Executive Order 14160, \"Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship.\" The executive order references Dred Scott v. Sandford, presents an ahistorical view, and attempts to strip birthright citizenship from people born on American soil to immigrant parents.\nAt the time of writing, Judge Lee Sorokin has issued a preliminary injunction on the Executive Order, stating in a memo that his decision to do so was \"based on straightforward application of settled Supreme Court precedent reiterated and reaffirmed in various ways for more than a century by all three branches of the federal government.\"\nA good historical summary on birthright citizenship in the U.S. is \"The Civil War and Reconstruction Amendments' Effects on Citizenship and Migration\"4.\nWhat's Next for SlaveCodes.org\n\nI intend to translate this slave code to Portuguese, Spanish, and French.\nI will begin work transcribing the 1684 Code Noir, 1784 Codigo Negro Carolino, and the D.C. Slave Code of 1848.\nI'll see about getting a logo made!\n\nIf you would like to contribute to this project, check out how you can contribute here.\nRecently I have come across another slave legislation transcribing project, Laws of Enslavement and Freedom in the Anglo-Atlantic World. It is a great resource and has focus on British Trans-Atlantic Slave Legislation.\nReferences\n1\nWikipedia: Freedom of Choice Act\n\n2\nPew Research on Public Opinion Over Abortion\n\n3\nEdward B.

I found myself exploring the migration of drums in the Atlantic slave trade, trying to understand why the drums seemed less central to African American music compared to other parts of the African diaspora across the Americas.\nThis curiosity led me down a path of historical inquiry into slave codes and their effect on music in the Americas. What I learned was intriguing but the experience was equally frustrating: information on slave codes was scattered and difficult to access. If I struggled to find this information, it must be challenging for others.\nAnd so, SlaveCodes.org was born. No one should have to struggle so much to learn about the slave codes. Slave codes are foundational jurisprudence to the colonies and subsequent countries founded in the Americas.\nOur Mission\nSlaveCodes.org aims to collect, translate, and make accessible the slave codes that were in effect during the Atlantic Slave Trade, from the 1400s to the late 1800s. Our focus spans the Americas, encompassing laws drafted by colonial powers under Portuguese, English, American, French, and Spanish rule.\nWe're committed to translating these codes into English, Spanish, Portuguese, and French â€” the primary languages of the Atlantic slave trade. Our goal is to make this crucial historical information as accessible as possible to researchers, educators, and the general public.\nThe Lasting Impact of Slave Codes\nThe importance of studying slave codes extends far beyond historical curiosity. These laws laid the groundwork for many aspects of modern society, influencing everything from racial attitudes to legal structures. Let's explore a few examples:\n\n\nStigmatization of Interracial Relationships: The 1724 Code Noir of Louisiana forbade marriages between whites and blacks. Similar laws persisted in the United States until 1967, when Loving v. Virginia finally struck them down. Interestingly, Loving v. Virginia was cited in all but one opinion in the 2022 ruling of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, demonstrating the enduring legal relevance of these historical laws.\n\n\nPolicing and Incarceration: Slave codes often empowered all white people to police the movements and gatherings of enslaved individuals. For instance, Act 13 of the 1724 Code Noir of Louisiana allowed any white person to arrest enslaved people gathered in groups. In the United States, these de jure laws evolved into Jim Crow laws; and policing social psychology continues today influencing modern policing and incarceration practices that disproportionately affect Black communities.\n\n\nFreedom of Movement and Expression: Many slave codes required enslaved people to carry passes when traveling off plantations. This concept of restricting movement and expression persisted long after slavery's abolition. For the vast majority of the 20th century, New York's Cabaret Laws required licenses for jazz musicians â€” often Black artists â€” to perform, echoing the control mechanisms of slavery. Similarly, in Miami's Overtown, Black residents had to carry a police card of some kind. \"The passes themselves came in different forms. Sometimes a simple note from a white employer would be enough to save a black laborer from 'an incident.'\"1 These practices demonstrate how the legacy of slave codes continued to impact Black communities' freedom of movement and expression well into the modern era.\n\n\nJoin Our Effort\nCreating a comprehensive repository of slave codes is an enormous undertaking, and we need your help. Whether you can provide full texts of slave codes, translations, or scholarly analysis, your input is invaluable. Please check out our Contribution Guidelines to learn more about how you can help and what we're looking for.\nAs we build this resource, we're committed to maintaining the highest standards of historical accuracy. All contributions will be carefully vetted to ensure they meet the rigorous standards expected by academic researchers while remaining accessible to the general public.\nWe invite you to explore the slave codes, read our blog posts, and join us in this crucial work of historical preservation and social understanding. To get started, take a look at the 1724 Louisiana Code Noir, currently the only published slave code on our site. But stay tuned â€” we plan to add about five other slave codes from around the Americas by the end of 2024, including the 1661 Barbados Slave Code, 1664 Jamaica Slave Code, 1684 Code Noir, 1784 Codigo Negro Carolino, and 1860 District of Columbia Slave Code.\nThe Drum Ban: A Case Study in Cultural Suppression\nRemember the drums that sparked this journey? They offer a poignant example of how slave codes shaped cultural development. Several slave codes explicitly banned drums, recognizing their potential as tools for communication and community-building among enslaved people.\nFor instance, following the Stono Rebellion in 1739, South Carolina's Slave Act of 1740 prohibited \"drums, horns, or other loud instruments, which may call together, or give sign or notice to one another of their wicked designs or purposes.\" Similar laws were enacted in Georgia and other states.2\nThis suppression had lasting effects, fundamentally altering the development of African American music. African American jazz legend Dizzy Gillespie eloquently described this impact in his autobiography: \"It's strange how the white people tried to keep us separate from the Africans and from our heritage. That's why, today, you don't hear in our music, as much as you do in other parts of the world, African heritage, because they took our drum away from us.\"\nThe loss went beyond just the physical instruments. Gillespie noted a profound rhythmic shift: \"As far as our heritage goes, ... with those few exceptions when they took our drums away, our music developed along a monorhythmic line. It wasn't polyrhythmic like African music.\"3 This transition from the rich, layered polyrhythms characteristic of African music to a simpler monorhythmic structure illustrates the deep-seated cultural impact of slave codes, reshaping the very foundation of African American musical expression relative to the rest of the African diaspora.\nSlaveCodes.org is more than just a historical archive â€” it's a tool for understanding the roots of many contemporary social issues. By shining a light on these foundational legal structures, we hope to contribute to more informed discussions about race, law, and society in the modern world. Join us in this crucial work of historical preservation and social understanding. Together, we can uncover the often-hidden foundations of our society and work towards a more just future.\nReferences\n1\nConnolly, Nathan Daniel Beau. \"Colored, Caribbean, and Condemned: Miami's overtown district and the cultural expense of progress, 1940-1970.\" Caribbean Studies (2006): 3-60.\n\n2\nJohnson, Christopher.

It was a revised and adapted version of the original 1685 Code Noir, tailored to address the specific conditions and concerns of the Louisiana colony. This code played a crucial role in shaping the social, economic, and racial dynamics of colonial Louisiana.\nHistorical Context\nBy the early 18th century, the French colony of Louisiana was developing its own distinct society and economy. The need for labor in the developing plantation system, combined with the unique racial and cultural makeup of the colony, necessitated a revised set of laws to govern slavery and race relations. The 1724 Louisiana Code Noir was drafted under the administration of Governor Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville to meet these needs.\nKey Provisions\nThe 1724 Louisiana Code Noir included several significant provisions:\n\n\nReligious Practices: Like its predecessor, it mandated the conversion of all enslaved people to Roman Catholicism and prohibited the practice of any other religion.\n\n\nLegal Status: It defined the status of enslaved Africans as movable property while also recognizing certain legal rights.\n\n\nManumission: The code outlined procedures for manumission (freeing of slaves) but made the process more restrictive than in the 1685 version.\n\n\nRacial Classifications: It introduced more detailed racial classifications, including specific regulations for people of mixed racial heritage.\n\n\nPunishment: The code specified punishments for various offenses committed by enslaved people and for slaveholders who violated the code.\n\n\nSlave Trade Regulation: It included provisions regulating the slave trade in Louisiana.\n\n\nProhibition of Interracial Relationships: The code strictly forbade interracial marriages and imposed severe penalties for sexual relationships between whites and blacks.\n\n\nUnique Aspects\nThe 1724 Louisiana Code Noir had several features that distinguished it from the 1685 version:\n\nIt placed greater emphasis on maintaining racial boundaries, reflecting the more complex racial dynamics in Louisiana.\nThe code included more detailed regulations on the treatment of free people of color, a growing population in Louisiana.\nIt imposed stricter controls on slave gatherings and movements, likely in response to fears of slave rebellions.\nThe Louisiana code was more restrictive in terms of manumission, making it more difficult for slaveholders to free enslaved individuals.\n\nImpact and Legacy\nThe 1724 Louisiana Code Noir had far-reaching consequences:\n\nIt solidified the legal basis for slavery in French Louisiana and later influenced laws under Spanish and American rule.\nThe code's strict racial classifications contributed to the development of Louisiana's unique racial hierarchy.\nIts provisions shaped social relations in Louisiana for generations, influencing everything from family structures to economic practices.\nThe code's legacy continued to impact Louisiana's legal system even after the Louisiana Purchase and into the antebellum period.\n\nComparison to Other Codes\nWhile based on the 1685 Code Noir, the Louisiana version was notably more restrictive and detailed in its racial classifications. It shared some similarities with other colonial slave codes but was unique in its adaptation to the specific conditions of Louisiana.\nConclusion\nThe 1724 Louisiana Code Noir represents a significant moment in the legal history of slavery in North America. Its study provides crucial insights into the development of racial ideologies, colonial governance, and the complex legal structures that supported slavery in the French colonies and later in the United States.\n\nNote: This overview provides a general introduction to the 1724 Louisiana Code Noir.
